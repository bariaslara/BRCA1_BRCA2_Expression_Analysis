# BRCA1_BRCA2_Expression_Analysis
A project for cleaning, merging, and analyzing BRCA1/2 mutation data with expression levels and PSA correlations.

# BRCA1 and BRCA2 Expression Analysis

## Overview
This project focuses on cleaning and analyzing BRCA1 and BRCA2 mutation data alongside clinical sample information and mRNA expression levels. The analysis also investigates correlations between BRCA1/2 expression and PSA levels.

## Features
- Data cleaning and merging of BRCA mutation, clinical, and expression data.
- Visualization of expression levels for BRCA1 and BRCA2.
- Scatter plot analysis of PSA levels and gene expression correlations.

## Files
- `cleaning.py`: Script to clean and merge mutation, clinical, and expression data.
- `analysis.py`: Script to visualize BRCA1/2 expression levels and explore correlations with PSA levels.

## Dependencies
- `pandas`
- `matplotlib`
